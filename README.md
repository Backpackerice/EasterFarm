A single-player arcade game - a team project for Telerik Academy 2015's Object-oriented Programming course

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamRaspberry-Telerik/EasterFarm/master/EasterFarm/Screenshots/start.png"></p>

Hans, lambs and bunnies running in a **farm**, eating berries and producing Easter eggs and milk. Easter presents made in a **present factory** from ingredients bought from a **market** place. Wolves and foxes, sneaking in the farm, trying to steal all the livestock and ruin Easter. Intrigued yet?

###Game logic
There are three different 'boards' on which the player plays the game:

* **The Farm** - where the hens eat berries and lay eggs. This is where villains - foxes and wolfs come and the player should keep the board clear of them.
* **The Market** - where the player buys stuff - flour, cocoa, baskets and ribbons in exchange for berries. These are necessary for producing Easter presents.
* **The Present Factory** - where the player makes presents to sell them in the market and gain money (or raspberries in our case).

####What happens in the Farm:
In the farm, hens eat berries and lay different coloured Easter eggs, depending on the type of berry they have eaten. Rabbits collect berries and paint an egg turning it into a Trophy Egg and sheep eat berries and give milk.

####What happens on the Market:
The market is the place, where exchanging of products and presents happens. Flour, cocoa, baskets, ribbons and a rabbit model are necessary ingredients for the presents that are produced in the Present factory. Those presents on the other hand can be exchanged on the market for more Raspberries.

####What happens in the Present Factory:
In the factory the player can produce different types of presents (Kozunak, Cookie, Choco rabbit, Choco egg, etc.) given they have the needed ingredients (bought from the market or collected in the farm)

####Your role
You are in the role of a **farm manager**. Your goal is to gain more raspberries by managing your farm, protecting your livestock from villains, buying stuff from the market and making presents with the in order to sell them.

Make this holiday special for you and for everyone around you!
