# EasterFarm
Easter Farm: arcade game - a Telerik Academy Project, course OOP

The player aims to make (produce in the Present Factory) a number of specific presents (usually food) typical for Easter. When he/she collects the required stuff Easter comes and the level has been finished. On each level he/she has a different task (list of presents) that he/she have to produce. For each subsequent level the player needs more resources to accoplish the quest. At the same time there are anemies that the players must keep away from the farm. If all the livestock (hens and sheeps(lambs)) has been eaten, than the Game is over.

There are three different 'boards' on which the game:
- The Farm where the hens eat berries and lay eggs. This is where the moles, the foxes and the wolfs come, so the player should keep the board clear of them;
- The Market where the player buy stuff from - berries for feeding the henses, flour, cocoa, baskets and ribbons. He/she exchanges eggs and other things for thees products.
- The Present factory, where the player makes presents - the required things to accomplish the thask for the specific level.

What happens in the Farm:
- Hens eat berries and when they do this, they lay different coloured eggs. Depending on what they have eaten, they lay a different egg. (Can they lay a cocoa egg or it shoul be upgreated in the Factory???). Sheeps (lambs) eat berries and give milk. Both hens and sheeps move randomly on the field and when they meet berry, they eat it. If the player has enough milk he can bring up a lamb (Струва ми се, че така е по-смислено). The player can exchange all these products for other stuff on the Market, or he/she can make presents in the factory using them;
- There are villians, which are bad for the Farm - The moles eat the berries from the farm and the foxes and the woolfs eat the hens and sheeps(lambs). They also move randomly, but the farmer can shoot them;

What happens in the Present Factory:
- Rabbits work in the Factory to produce presents, but they can be also used to make presents from them. They also eat berries;
- In the factory the player can produce: EasterRabbit (With ribbon, Choco rabbit, Whith trophy egg), EasterBasket (Whith ribbon, Whith cookies, With Choco eggs), EasterFood (Kozunak, Kookie, Choco egg, Cheverme (from a lamb:) ));

What happens on the Market:
- The player exchanges what he/she has for what he/she needs. Flour, cocoa, ribbons, baskets, berries can be bought from the market. The player can sell on the market things that he/she produced in the Farm (eggs and milk) or in the Factory (EasterRabbit, EasterBasket, EasterFood);
